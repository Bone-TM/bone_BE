# Bone-TM Back End DatabaseBone
Bone is an application that provides dogs and their owners a safe way to connect for playdates end other events because dogs deserve a social life too.

Using service based architecture, we created the back end database to accomodate our front end so that it could quickly and securely perform transactions through our database.
